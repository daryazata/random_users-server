## Random Users-Countries Filter Backend

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Server will start in the background. It consumes the random-user api: https://randomuser.me .
Server also runs a periodic api refetch - with help of the [node-cron](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron) library, (for testing purposes every 30 sec)

## deployment
